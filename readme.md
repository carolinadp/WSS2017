## Project: Figure out the value of a resistor from an image

### Statement of the problem
Even if Wolfram Alpha contains a tool to obtain the value of a resistor given the colors of its bands, it needs the user to write the colors to obtain this result. The goal of this project is to obtain the color codes from a resistor given a photo of it.

### Outline of the future solution
The currently planned approach is to first remove the background of the image, then crop the image to make the resistor and the bands the only thing visible, once cropped extract the colors. It will be necessary to train a classifier with photos of the all band colors in different illuminations to the extraction to be successful.
